// Create a full api usnig Rust low level libraries such as hyper, tokio, Tower.
// Since this is a learning project, this implementation will be done in phases, each phase will be a separate binary in the src/bin directory. 
// The final phase will be a complete API server that can handle HTTP requests, manage state, and perform basic GET operations.
